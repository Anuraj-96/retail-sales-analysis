# retail-sales-analysis
End-to-end data analysis project using Python, MySQL and Tableau. From [raw retail order data](https://github.com/Anuraj-96/retail-sales-analysis/blob/main/orders.csv) to cleaned insights, visualizations, and a professional dashboard highlighting sales performance and profitability metrics.

## Project Overview
This project explores and analyzes a retail dataset to uncover key insights about sales, revenue, and customer behavior across the United States. It combines Python (Pandas) for data cleaning, MySQL for KPI calculation and transformation, and Tableau for creating dynamic, interactive dashboards.

## Steps Taken 
1 Loaded the Raw CSV into Python  
- Inspected using python
- Checked for missing values
- Handled Nulls and Fixed Data Types

2 Exported Cleaned CSV
- Final file saved as retail_cleaned.csv

3 Imported into MySQL
- Created new analytical columns using SQL  
Additional calculated columns:  
discount_amount  = List Price * Discount % / 100  
sale_price       = List Price - Discount Amount  
revenue          = Sale Price √ó Quantity  
profit           = (Sale Price - Cost Price) √ó Quantity  

These new columns made it easier to analyze: Revenue trends , Profit margins , Discount impact

## Tools used
